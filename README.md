# Daft.ie exclude listings

Useful when you are searching for a new place to stay and you found that a listing you have already checked out is not for you. This way you can remove it from the map and only the new listings and the ones you are interested in will appear!

Right now to exclude it you have to modify the code and add the id of the listing to exclude, but I plan to add a button to exclude automatically. You can find the id of the listing in the full URL of the listing, at the end, like this:

<https://www.daft.ie/share/.../1234567>

Where 1234567 is the listing.
